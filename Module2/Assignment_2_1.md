## Assignment

### Brief

The objective of this assignment is to gain a deeper understanding of cloud computing, hybrid computing and traditional computing and the benefits and limitations of each.

1. Research the different types of computing models, including cloud computing, hybrid computing, and traditional computing.
2. Choose a specific use case (e.g. a small business, a startup, a large enterprise) and determine which computing model would be the most appropriate for that use case, providing a detailed explanation of your reasoning.
3. Compare and contrast the benefits and limitations of each model, including cost, scalability, security, and flexibility.
4. Write a report summarizing your research, including a comparison and contrast of the different computing models and an analysis of the chosen use case.

Presentation with your own group about which method that will you use to handle these case

Case:

- Newly Launched eCommerce

| |Cloud Computing | Traditional computing | hybrid computing
|--|--|--|--|
cost        |   lower start up cost incured, charge is usage base | higher start up cost due to the need for space and buying the hardware | inbetween full cloud and traditional | 
scalability | easily scalable | not easily scalable | easily scalable | 
security    | cloud providers provide a large range of tools to enhance security | security needs to be taken into your own hands to set it up | Although making use of the cloud's tools for security, we are still partically responsible for the the security on prem |
flexibility | highly flexible as you can scale up and down depending on needs easily | Not flexible as you have a cap in the resources you have. your cost / use basis could also be high | Flexible in terms of governance, you can decide which applications need to be in private/public cloud. |

Based on the following factors above we rate the following:
> cost : cloud computing - poor at the start, this one cheapest

>scalability : cloud computing - for future needs

>security : cloud computing - easy to manage for a smaller company

>flexibility : cloud computing - easily scale in and out based on needs is curcial based on consumer sentiments e.g 11/11 may have high traffic need to scale up

**CONCLUSION: Cloud computing**
