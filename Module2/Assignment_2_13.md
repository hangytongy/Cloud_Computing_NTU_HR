### what is Cloud Architecture Design - Performance?

Cloud architecture design for performance refers to the process of creating an infrastructure within a cloud computing environment that optimizes the system's ability to deliver high performance. This includes designing the architecture in such a way that it can efficiently handle workloads, maximize throughput, minimize latency, and ensure scalability to accommodate varying levels of demand

### What system design to use for Performance?
There are certain performance principals to think about when performance efficiency is concerned. Democratising advanced technologies, meaning self hosting most of the online clouds resources, being able to go global in minutes, by using AWS, Azure etc. Using severless architecture may remove operational burdenof managing physical servers

Try to use more ways to automate testing and getting a sense of the unexpected to build better servers.

Using monitoring can also help significantly to be able to observe and improve the performance of things.
